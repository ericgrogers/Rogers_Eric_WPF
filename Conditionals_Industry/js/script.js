/* This program is a basic billing and payment calculator for the web design/development industry. It will calculate the amount to be billed for 3 different services at different hourly rates, and include an optional maintenance package if the client desires one. It will figure out the retainer fee to be charged, as well as the number of payments and amounts to be paid before final delivery.
